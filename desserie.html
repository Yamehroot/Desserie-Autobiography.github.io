      <p style="color: black;font-family: Arial;font-size:23;"> I am Desserie Da√±o Bongcales. I was born on February 27, 2003, at Talima, Olango Island, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines. We are six siblings in the family; I have two brothers and three sisters, and I am the youngest child of the family. My mother's name is Dioscora Bongcales; she is a housewife, and she's from where I live right now. And my father's name is Martin Bongcales; he is a fisherman, and he's from Bontoc, Southern Leyte. I had a happy childhood living with my parents and siblings. I took up my elementary education at Talima Elementary School, located in Talima Lapu-Lapu City, and my secondary education at Sta.Rosa National High School, located in Sta.Rosa Lapu-Lapu City. And currently, I am a college student at Lapu-Lapu City College, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology with a major in Computer Technology.

   <p style="color:indigo;font-family: Arial;font-size:23; ">During my childhood days, I usually spent time playing with my neighbors and sisters. My hobbies are reading Wattpad stories, listening to music, watching random videos on social media, and I love singing and dancing. My dream is to become a successful woman who can provide for the needs of my parents and family. All I want in the future is the happiness of my parents. I can give them what they want, especially the things that they wanted before but never got because of our situation right now. I also want to help my relatives and other people.
   </p>
   
   <p style="color: brown;font-family:Arial;font-size:23;">I am so motivated to create the best possible future for myself that I would study and work hard to set it up. I know that I will encounter more struggles and challenges before I can be successful in the future, but no matter what happens, I will never give up because I do believe that if you do it, you can achieve it. All you have to do is be patient, trust the process, and, of course, always have God in your heart.
